---

We've all seen the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI agents. But feeding them content effectively? That's a different story. Standard formats often fall short, stripping away vital context needed for reliable AI processing, especially for complex documents or web pages.

Converting content to plain text for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or agent workflows can lose crucial structure and metadata, leading to imprecise results.

Introducing **MAGI (Markdown for Agent Guidance & Instruction)**. An _AI-native_, _human-readable_, and _extensible_ Markdown format designed to solve this.

## Why MAGI?

### The Problem

... so you want your AI to *really* understand your content. Let's walk through the usual struggle:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Just use Plain Text?">
    <Warning>
      Stripping content down seems easy, but...
      - Where did that table structure go?
      - What was the original source URL?
      - How does this document relate to others?
      - How do I tell the AI *how* to process this specific section?
      - Oops, lost all the metadata (author, date, purpose).
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maybe HTML directly?">
    <Note>
      HTML is structured, but often noisy for LLMs:
      - Full of tags irrelevant to the core meaning.
      - Doesn't explicitly define inter-document relationships.
      - No standard way to embed processing instructions for the AI.
      - Can be complex to parse reliably.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Building custom pre-processing pipelines?">
     <Card title="The Engineering Overhead">
       - Complex parsers for different formats (PDF, DOCX, HTML).
       - Heuristics for extracting metadata (often inaccurate).
       - Separate systems for managing relationships.
       - Ad-hoc methods for passing instructions to the LLM.
       - Constant maintenance as source formats change.

  </Step>
</Steps>

And you find yourself asking...

> "Isn't there a simpler way to make content both human-readable *and* AI-ready?"

### The Solution: MAGI

MAGI extends standard Markdown, keeping it readable while adding optional, structured layers for AI.

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Structured Metadata" icon="list">
    <div className="text-emerald-700 space-y-1">
    - YAML Front Matter for rich context.
    - Define `doc-id`, `title`, `tags`, `purpose`, dates, etc.
    - Essential for classification and retrieval.
    </div>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Embedded AI Instructions" icon="code">
    <div className="text-emerald-700 space-y-1">
    - Use `ai-script` blocks for direct commands.
    - Guide summarization, analysis, model choice.
    - Control processing within the content itself.
    </div>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Explicit Relationships" icon="link">
    <div className="text-emerald-700 space-y-1">
    - Define document links using Markdown footnotes.
    - Specify types: `parent`, `child`, `cites`, `related`.
    - Build knowledge graphs automatically.
    </div>
  </Card>
  <Card title="Human & Machine Friendly" icon="circle-check">
    <div className="text-emerald-700 space-y-1">
    - Remains standard Markdown for readability.
    - Legacy renderers see normal text/code blocks.
    - MAGI-aware processors unlock AI potential.
    - Optional components: Use only what you need.
    </div>
  </Card>

Stop fighting content conversion. Focus on building intelligent applications while MAGI provides the AI-ready foundation.

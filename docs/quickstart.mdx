To start working with MAGI, you'll need:

1. A basic understanding of Markdown
2. A text editor for creating .mda files
3. Optionally, the url2mda tool to convert web content to MAGI format
### Understanding MAGI Components
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understanding MAGI Components" icon="file-code">
    MAGI has three optional components that enhance standard Markdown:
    
    1. **YAML Front Matter**: Provides structured metadata (like `title`, `doc-id`).
    2. **ai-script blocks**: Embeds JSON instructions for AI/LLM processing.
    3. **Footnotes with JSON**: Defines typed relationships between documents (e.g., `[^ref1]: {"rel-type": ...}`).

    Each component is optional - use only what you need.
  </Accordion>

## Creating a Simple MAGI File

Create a file with the `.mda` extension. Here's an example structure:

```markdown
---
doc-id: "example-123"
title: "My First MAGI Document"
description: "A simple example of MAGI format"
tags: ["example", "getting-started"]
created-date: "2024-06-10T10:00:00Z"

# Hello MAGI

This is standard Markdown content.

(Your ai-script block would go here - see below)

This document is related to our documentation[^ref1].

[^ref1]: See JSON definition below.

```
### Adding AI Instructions

Inside your `.mda` file, you can add an `ai-script` block like this:

```ai-script
{
  "script-id": "summary-request",
  "prompt": "Summarize this document briefly.",
  "priority": "medium",
  "auto-run": true
}
```

## Convert Web Content with url2mda

The easiest way to test MAGI is with our url2mda service, which converts web pages to MAGI format:

```bash
curl -X POST https://url2mda.sno.ai/convert \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "htmlDetails": true,
    "subpages": false
  }'
```

Try it out in your browser: [https://url2mda.sno.ai](https://url2mda.sno.ai)

## Explore the Open Source Toolkit

MAGI is fully open source and includes tools like url2mda that you can run locally:

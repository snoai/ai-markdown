# Generating Content Dynamically

AIMD allows embedding instructions directly into the document. This can be used by AI agents to generate or modify content based on the context.

## Section 1: Complex Topic Explanation

Quantum entanglement is a physical phenomenon that occurs when a group of particles are generated, interact, or share spatial proximity in such a way that the quantum state of each particle of the group cannot be described independently of the state of the others, including when the particles are separated by a large distance.


```ai-script
<!-- AI-PROCESSOR: The block below asks for a simplified explanation -->
{
  "script-id": "explain-entanglement-simple-v1",
  "prompt": "Explain the concept of quantum entanglement described above in simpler terms, suitable for a high school student.",
  "priority": "medium",
  "auto-run": false,
  "provider": "anthropic",
  "model-name": "claude-3-sonnet",
  "parameters": {
    "temperature": 0.6
  },
  "output-format": "markdown"
}
```

## Section 2: Market Analysis Overview

The recent market trends indicate a significant shift towards renewable energy sources. Solar panel installations saw a 40% year-over-year increase, while wind energy investments grew by 25%. However, challenges remain in grid modernization and energy storage solutions.

```ai-script
{
  "script-id": "summarize-market-trends-v2",
  "prompt": "Provide a 2-sentence summary of the key market trends discussed in the preceding paragraph.",
  "priority": "high",
  "auto-run": true,
  "parameters": {
    "max-tokens": 50
  },
  "runtime-env": "server",
  "output-format": "text"
}
```

This demonstrates how AI can be instructed to perform tasks like simplification or summarization directly within the document flow.
